<h1>Experiential Learning Dashboard</h1>
<h3 style=text-align:center;>Lacey Irby, Ashton Johnson, Maud Willemse, Maddie Beyer</h3>
<p>
  <h2>Project goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Have a form for users to submit projects</li>
    <li>Implement security measures for students, faculty, and staff</li>
    <li>Optional bulk data upload of other departments' databases</li>
    <li>Have a database with uniform language</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<h3 style=padding-left:50px;>1. Tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tableau - used for creating dashboards to aid in data visualization and user experience</li>
  <li>Excel - main utility for database storage</li>
  <li>MyBama API - used to have faculty, staff, and students log in; possible uses in grabbing existing databases of faculty, staff, and students</li>
  <li>WordPress - housing unit for all front-end work and Tableau dashboards</li>
  <li>Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS - main languages being used for creating the Wordpress site</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=padding-left:50px;>2. User experience</h3>
<p>This is  a flowchart based on what type of user is interacting with the product.</p>
<img src="user-scenarios.png" alt="alternatetext">
<p>All users will be able to access the landing page through the Department of Community Affairs and select the appropriate link based on whether
  they are a faculty/staff member, student, community member, or someone else looking to explore UA's current projects. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;">A faculty or staff member will be directed to the myBama login. They will then be able to select various areas of interest to them which
  will be reflected on the faculty/staff explore page. They may also browse the connection dashboard which shows potential community partnership opportunities.
  To add or edit a project which they own they will be directed to an ELO form with standardized dropdowns and data input. </p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;">A student will be directed to the myBama login and then be able to select areas of interest to them which will then be reflected
  on the student dashboard, where they can browse potential ELOs they would like to participate in.</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;">A community member seeking partnership with faculty/staff will also be able to select their corresponding areas
  of interest on the filter page which will be reflected on the community dashboard or submit a partner request form to reach
  out to a particular faculty/staff member which fits their project needs.</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;">Additional users such as prospective students, faculty and staff from other universities, donors, etc. will be
  able to view all of UAs ongoing EOL opportunities on the explore dashboard.</p>
